# Tech Cabinet

Rental system for the EUS' tech cabinet.

Currently a work-in-progress. The features are slowly being implemented, so code quality is not good (for now).

To run the front-end, navigate to `frontend/` and run:

- `yarn install`
- `yarn start`

To run the back-end, navigate to `backend/` and run:

- `python -m venv venv`
- `source venv/bin/activate`
- `python setup.py`
- `python app.py`
